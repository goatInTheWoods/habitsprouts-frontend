HabitSprouts is a habit-tracking app with three main features:

- **Simple, User-Friendly Interface**

    Less is more. We include only essential functions and remove all unnecessary details. No need to deal with trivial elements like how many times a day or which days you perform a habit; we simply count the number of days you've completed it. You'll find that this simplicity is more than enough.
    
- **Minimalistic Note Feature — Focus on the Process**

    You can make notes for your habits, creating a valuable record of your progress. Think about the habits you want to build. Are they something you only want to do this year and abandon next year? Probably not. You likely want to build good habits for life. Making a note is a good way to appreciate every moment of your lifelong journey. Document your ups and downs here. One day, you’ll see how these short moment are all connected to the better version of you. Plus, these notes are most powerful encouragement than any alert messages or famous quotes!
    

- **Statistics and Calendar Chart**
